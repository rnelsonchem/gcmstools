gcmstools - Basic GCMS File Import and Fitting
##############################################

This library serves two roles: 1) to provide a class to read standard GCMS
data files, and 2) to fit the data using various fitting routines.

Currently, this package implements the following:

*File Types*

* AIA (CDF) file import

*Fitting Routines*

* Non-negative least squares (nnls) fitting

The usage and installation of this package is outlined in the `online user
guide`_, which is also `available as a
pdf`_.
