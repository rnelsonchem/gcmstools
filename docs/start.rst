Getting started
###############

*gcmstools* is a Python package that reads some GCMS file formats and does
simple fitting. The source code for this project can be found on `GitHub`_. If
you are reading this in PDF format, there is `online documentation`_ as well.

This user guide is broken into a few sections. 

#. :doc:`Installation <install>`: Information about getting a Python
   installation up and running and installing *gcmstools*.

#. :doc:`Basic Usage <basics>`: This section covers the usage of *gcmstools*
   to manipulate and plot GCMS data. 

#. :doc:`Referenceing and Fitting <fitting>`: Incorportate refernce data into your
   GCMS data set, and use this to manually fit the GCMS data set.   

#. :doc:`Calibration <calibration>`: Make a calibration file and use this to extract
   generate concentration information from your data. 

#. :doc:`Batch Processing <autoint>`: Covers a simple function for automating
   this entire process. You can skip to this final sections if all you want to
   do is automate some data extractions. It is not necessary to understand the
   basics of data manipulation/plotting.

#. :doc:`Appendix A <appendA>`: Command line basics.The examples presented in
   this document require a basic working knowledge of a command-line terminal
   interface and running Python commands from an IPython interpreter. This
   section covers some of the basics.

#. Appendix B: Examples. Basic data extraction and plotting examples are
   presented.
