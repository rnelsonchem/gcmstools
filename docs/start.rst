Getting started
###############

*gcmstools* is a Python package that reads some GCMS file formats and does
simple fitting. The source code for this project can be found on `GitHub`_. If
you are reading this in PDF format, there is `online documentation`_ as well.

This user guide is broken into a few sections. 

#. :ref:`Installation <install>`: Information about getting a Python
   installation up and running and installing *gcmstools*.

#. :ref:`Basic Usage <basics>`: This section covers the usage of *gcmstools*
   to manipulate and plot GCMS data. 

#. :ref:`Fitting <fit>`: The information in this section covers manual fitting of a
   GCMS data set. 
   
#. :ref:`Calibration <cal>` and :ref:`Batch Processing <batch>`: These final
   sections cover calibration curves and automated data extraction.

You can skip to the final sections if all you want to do is automate some data
extractions. It is not necessary to understand the basics of data
manipulation/plotting as those tasks are automated in the calibration and
batch processing steps.

.. note::
    
    The examples presented in this document require a basic working knowledge
    of a command-line terminal interface and running Python commands from an
    interpreter. :ref:`Appendix A <cli>` covers the basics that you will need
    to run these examples.
