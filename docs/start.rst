Getting started
###############

*gcmstools* is a Python package that reads some GCMS file formats and does
some simple types of fitting. The source code for this project can be found on
`GitHub`_. If you are reading this in PDF format, there is `online
documentation`_ as well.

This user guide is broken into a few sections. First of all, there is
information about getting a Python installation up and running. This is
followed by a section on the basic usage of *gcmstools* to manipulate and plot
GCMS data. There is also a section about fitting the GCMS datasets. The final
section covers generating calibration curves and automating data extraction
with this calibration information. You can skip to that section if all you
want to do is automate some data extractions. (It is not necessary to
understand the data manipulation/plotting as that is automated in the final
section.)
