Getting started
###############

*gcmstools* is a Python package that reads some GCMS file formats and does
simple fitting and calibration. The source code for this project can be found
on `GitHub`_. If you are reading this in PDF format, there is `online
documentation`_ as well.

This user guide is broken into a few sections. 

#. :doc:`Installation <install>`: Information about getting a Python
   installation up and running and installing *gcmstools*.

#. :doc:`Basic Setup <basics>`: Go here first to learn about the basic setup
   and to get some sample data. This is necessary to follow this
   documentation.

#. :doc:`File Types <filetypes>`: This covers the supported file types, their
   properties, and some simple plotting.

#. :doc:`Referenceing and Fitting <fitting>`: Incorporate reference data into
   your GCMS dataset and use this to fit the data.   

#. :doc:`Data Storage <storage>`: Create a storage container for your
   processed GCMS datasets. These containers are necessary for the next step
   in the process.

#. :doc:`Calibration <calibration>`: Generate calibration curves and use this
   information to extract concentration information from you sample datasets.

#. :doc:`Batch Processing <autoint>`: A simple function for automating this
   entire process is presented. You can skip to this section if all you want
   to do is automate some data extractions. It is not necessary to understand
   the basics of data manipulation, calibration, etc.

#. :doc:`Appendix A <appendA>`: Command line basics. The examples presented in
   this document require a basic working knowledge of using a command-line
   terminal interface and of running Python commands from an IPython
   interpreter.  This section covers some of the basics.

#. :doc:`Appendix B <appendB>`: Examples. Basic data extraction and plotting
   examples are presented. Check out this section if you want some ideas about
   processing, plotting, or extracting data.
