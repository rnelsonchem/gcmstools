Getting started
###############

*gcmstools* is a Python package that reads some GCMS file formats and does
simple fitting. The source code for this project can be found on `GitHub`_. If
you are reading this in PDF format, there is `online documentation`_ as well.

This user guide is broken into a few sections. 

#. :doc:`Installation <install>`: Information about getting a Python
   installation up and running and installing *gcmstools*.

#. :doc:`Basic Usage <basics>`: This section covers the usage of *gcmstools*
   to manipulate and plot GCMS data. 

#. :doc:`Referenceing and Fitting <fitting>`: Incorporate reference data into your
   GCMS data set, and use this to manually fit the GCMS data set.   

#. :doc:`Data Storage <storage>`: Create a storage container for your
   processed GCMS datasets. This provides a convenient storage container for
   your data, and is necessary for the next step in the process.

#. :doc:`Calibration <calibration>`: Make a calibration file and use this to extract
   generate concentration information from your data. 

#. :doc:`Batch Processing <autoint>`: Introduces a simple function for
   automating this entire process. You can skip to this section if all you
   want to do is automate some data extractions. It is not necessary to
   understand the basics of data manipulation/plotting.

#. :doc:`Appendix A <appendA>`: Command line basics.The examples presented in
   this document require a basic working knowledge of a command-line terminal
   interface and running Python commands from an IPython interpreter. This
   section covers some of the basics.

#. :doc:`Appendix B <appendB>`: Examples. Basic data extraction and plotting
   examples are presented. Check out this section if you want some ideas about
   processing, plotting, or extracting data.
